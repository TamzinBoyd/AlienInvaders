BRIEF

Create a text based/basic alien shooting game using OOP 3 types of ships holding different hit scores When a ship is hit the points are deducted Game over is when all ships have 0 points or Mother ship has 0 points

FUNCTIONALITY

I wanted to store each ship in an Object, created from a class as all keys will be the same for each ship. Method to calculate current points based on points minus hit deduct points. Button to generate a random ship allocation to hit. When the ship is hit, access the object to deduct points and update current points. When a ship reaches 0 points, link to HTML and add a hidden class Recognise when all current points are 0/Mother ship 0 and show "game over - you've won". Restart button to start the game again Basic animation added to shoot button using Javascript timer delay

IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED

Add timer
Add animation for shooting action
